# rock-paper-scissor-tkinter
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with Python's Tkinter library. Players can choose rock, paper, or scissors, and the game automatically determines the winner based on the user's input versus the computer's choice. The project showcases a basic understanding of GUI development and event handling in Tkinter.
